# 🎓 AI-Powered College Recommendation System

A comprehensive machine learning-based system that provides personalized college recommendations based on student profiles, academic performance, preferences, and career goals.

## 🌟 Features

- **Intelligent Matching**: Uses advanced ML algorithms to match students with suitable colleges
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers academic scores, budget, location, career goals, and personal interests
- **Flexible Text Processing**: Uses SentenceTransformers when available, falls back to TF-IDF for offline operation
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Beautiful Gradio-based UI for easy interaction
- **Cluster-based Recommendations**: Groups similar students and colleges for better matching
- **Budget-aware Filtering**: Respects financial constraints while suggesting alternatives
- **Location Preferences**: Prioritizes preferred locations while offering alternatives

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **StudentModel**: Processes and clusters student profiles
2. **CollegeModel**: Analyzes and groups colleges by characteristics
3. **Recommender**: Matches students to colleges using similarity scoring
4. **TextEmbedder**: Handles text processing with fallback support

### Machine Learning Pipeline

```
Student Data → Feature Engineering → PCA → KMeans Clustering
                                    ↓
College Data → Text Embedding → Similarity Calculation → Recommendations
```

## 📋 Requirements

### Essential Dependencies
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
gradio
pickle (built-in)
```

### Optional Dependencies
```
sentence-transformers  # For better text embeddings (fallback: TF-IDF)
```

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
# If using git
git clone <repository-url>
cd college-recommendation-system

# Or download the paste.txt file directly
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn gradio

# Optional: For better text processing
pip install sentence-transformers
```

### 3. Prepare Your Data
Place your datasets in the same directory:
- `student_dataset00.xlsx` - Student profiles dataset
- `210colleges_dataset_krip.ai.xlsx` - College information dataset

**Note**: If datasets are not available, the system will create sample data automatically.

### 4. Run the Training Script
```bash
python paste.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess your data
- Train the ML models
- Save trained models to `models/` directory
- Create the web interface file (`gradio_app.py`)

### 5. Launch the Web Interface
```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

The system will be available at `http://localhost:7860`

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Feature Engineering
- **Numerical Features**: Academic scores, rankings, fees
- **Categorical Features**: Location, type, approvals  
- **Text Features**: Courses, goals, activities using embeddings

### 2. Clustering
- Students grouped into 5 clusters based on profiles
- Colleges grouped into 8 clusters based on characteristics

### 3. Recommendation Process
- Predict student cluster and generate profile vector
- Calculate similarity with all colleges using cosine similarity
- Apply filters (budget, location preferences)
- Rank and return top matches

### 4. Scoring System
- **Similarity Score**: 0-1 scale based on profile matching
- **Budget Compatibility**: Prioritizes affordable options
- **Location Preference**: Boosts preferred location colleges
- **Academic Fit**: Matches entrance scores with college standards

## 🖥️ Using the Web Interface

### Input Fields
1. **Academic Information**
   - 10th & 12th marks
   - Entrance exam scores
   - Budget constraints

2. **Preferences & Background**
   - Location preferences
   - Personal details
   - Board and category

3. **Goals & Interests**
   - Career aspirations
   - Skills and certifications
   - Extracurricular activities

### Output
- Top 5 college recommendations
- Match scores and compatibility ratings
- College details (location, fees, type)
- Explanation of recommendation logic

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting Clusters
```python
# In main() function
student_model = StudentModel(num_clusters=5)  # Change number
college_model = CollegeModel(num_clusters=8)  # Change number
```

### Modifying Recommendation Count
```python
# In Gradio interface
recommendations = recommender.recommend(student_dict, top_n=5)  # Change top_n
```

### Adding New Features
1. Update the respective column lists in StudentModel/CollegeModel
2. Modify preprocessing methods
3. Retrain the models

## 📁 File Structure

```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Models not found" error**
```bash
# Make sure you've run the training script first
python paste.py
```

**2. "SentenceTransformers not available" warning**
```bash
# This is normal - system uses TF-IDF fallback
# For better results, install: pip install sentence-transformers
```

**3. Dataset loading errors**
- Ensure dataset files are in the correct location
- Check column names match expected format
- System will use sample data if files not found

**4. Memory issues with large datasets**
- Reduce PCA components in model initialization
- Decrease number of clusters
- Process data in smaller batches

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Datasets:**
```python
# Reduce feature dimensions
self.pca = PCA(n_components=5)  # Instead of 10

# Use smaller embeddings
self.text_embedder = TextEmbedder('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Smaller model
```

**For Faster Training:**
```python
# Reduce TF-IDF features
self.tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=200)  # Instead of 384
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test
```python
# Test with sample student
test_student = {
    'Marks_10th': 85,
    'Marks_12th': 82,
    'JEE_Score': 125,
    'Budget': 350000,
    'Preferred Location': 'Karnataka',
    # ... other fields
}

recommendations = recommender.recommend(test_student, top_n=5)
print(recommendations[['College Name', 'Similarity']])
```
